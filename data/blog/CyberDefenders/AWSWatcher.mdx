This is a **easy** level **cloud forensics** lab by [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/awswatcher/). You can complete your analysis using **AWS Management Console**. Start by reading `Before Getting Started` section for more info.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} asDisclosure />

## Before Getting Started

To solve this lab, you need access to the AWS Management Console. To obtain access, download the lab file containing the Account ID and Password by clicking on the **Download Lab Files** button. Once downloaded, use these credentials to log in and proceed with the lab.

## Capture The Flag

From this point onward, you will find a detailed breakdown of every step I took to find out each flag. You may have a different methodology, and that is completely fine.

### Q1 During the initial scanning, the attacker interacted with the web application from an external IP address. What is the origin IP tied to the attacker, as observed in the AWS logs?

- Start by opening **AWS GuardDuty**, a cloud service that monitors and processes logs to identify suspicious activity in your environment. Click on **View all findings** and start examining each alert. ![Q1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q1.png)

- We can see multiple alerts ranging from low to critical severity. I proceeded to open **critical** alert. ![Q1-1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q1-1.png)

- This alert notifies us of a **Potential data compromise**, which is quite serious. Additionally, we can see **MITRE-mapped TTPs** used by the attacker prior to the compromise. Let's identify the attacker's IP address. ![Q1-2](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q1-2.png)

- Scrolling further, we can find the attacker's IP address under **Endpoints**. ![Q1-3](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q1-3.png)

```
41.46.53.241
```

### Q2 A code review uncovered a function that lacked proper input validation, enabling arbitrary file processing. Which function’s misconfiguration directly enabled the initial exploit?

- Open the **AWS dashboard** again by clicking on the **AWS icon** at the top left. Then, navigate to **Lambda**, a serverless computing platform (**FaaS**). ![Q2](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q2.png)

- In the screenshot below, we can clearly see a function named **FileUpload**. Let's conduct a code review this function. ![Q2-1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q2-1.png)

- This function ensures that JSON logs are parsed correctly. However, it lacks proper validation for uploaded files, which is a significant security concern. It is highly likely that the **FileUpload** function is the root cause of the exploit. ![Q2-2](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q2-2.png)

```
FileUpload
```

### Q3 The attacker uploaded a file masquerading as a benign document but containing an embedded malicious payload. What’s the filename of the SVG payload disguised as a financial record?

- Open **AWS S3**, where all data storage buckets reside. We previously identified `compliantsecurestoreddumpstorage` as the storage bucket for files uploaded through the **FileUpload** function. ![Q3](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q3.png)

- Inside `compliantsecurestoreddumpstorage`, there is a folder named **Upload**. Let's open it. ![Q3-1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q3-1.png)

- Click on the **Type** bar to sort uploaded files by their extension. ![Q3-2](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q3-2.png)

- We can see a file named **financial_statement_2143.svg**, which is likely our flag. ![Q3-3](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q3-3.png)

```
financial_statement_2143.svg
```

### Q4 During analysis of the CloudWatch Logs, the attacker’s external IP address was observed invoking an API to upload files to an S3 bucket. What is the **exact URL path** used for this upload operation, as seen in the logs?

- To answer this question, open **CloudWatch Logs** and filter the logs by the attacker's IP address to locate the exact URL path used for the file upload. ![Q4](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q4.png)

- We can combine the **protocol** (`https://`), **domain name** (`upilqcjrp5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`), and the **path** (`/prod/dev/upload`) to obtain the exact URL. ![Q4-1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q4-1.png)

```
https://upilqcjrp5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/dev/upload
```

### Q5 Which IAM role with excessive permissions was abused during the attack and used to query sensitive S3 buckets?

- Open **GuardDuty** and revisit the critical alert. We can see that the **LambdaParser** role, which has excessive permissions, was exploited by the attacker. ![Q5](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q5.png)

```
LambdaParser
```

### Q6 What is the MITRE ATT&CK technique related to the attacker’s use of valid cloud credentials to log into the system?

- Reviewing the **MITRE ATT&CK** technique IDs in the GuardDuty alert, we can find out the technique linked to malicious use of valid cloud credentials. ![Q6](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q6.png)

```
T1078.004
```

### Q7 A server error inadvertently disclosed a temporary AWS access key in the debug logs. What is the AccessKeyId value that was leaked?

- In the **GetRole** API alert, we can find out the leaked **AccessKeyId**. ![Q7](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q7.png)

```
ASIASFUIRZ5AETONKITQ
```

### Q8 A critical alert was triggered when the attacker invoked an API to retrieve temporary credentials. What is the Event ID of the GetRole API call?

- To find the **Event ID**, filter the logs by **EventName** set to **GetRole** and specify the exact date mentioned in the **GetRole** GuardDuty alert. ![Q8](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q8.png)

- Open the **GetRole** alert triggered by the attacker's IP address. ![Q8-1](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q8-1.png)

- The **Event ID** is clearly visible in the screenshot below, which serves as our flag. ![Q8-2](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q8-2.png)

```
78efd559-c626-4002-b458-088a4cc80e53
```

### Q9 Analysis of HTTP User-Agent strings and CLI artifacts suggests the attacker was using a penetration-testing operating system. Which operating system was likely used by the attacker?

- Based on the **User-Agent** strings and other artifacts, we can clearly see that the attacker was using **Kali Linux**. ![Q9](/static/images/AWSWatcher/Q9.png)

```
Kali
```
