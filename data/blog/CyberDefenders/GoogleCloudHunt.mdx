This is a **medium** level **cloud forensics** lab by [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/googlecloudhunt/). You can complete your analysis using **JQ JSON Parser**. I have attached every command I used to get to the flag. Incase you get stuck or you don't understand a command, try to ask ChatGPT or Gemini for explanation of that topic or command.

## Scenario

A wide credential breach has recently affected multiple organizations across various sectors. This incident has raised concerns about potential unauthorized access to your organization operating within Google Cloud environment. As a cybersecurity analyst, your task is to conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compromise

### Q1 We need to determine if a user has fallen victim to the credential breach, which user account was compromised?

```shell
jq ".[].protoPayload | {authenticationInfo,requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}" logs.json
```

![Q1](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q1.png)

```
david.smith8391273718@gmail.com
```

### Q2 In the attacker's initial exploration of the environment, what is the name of the first Google Cloud Storage bucket they accessed?

```shell
jq ".[].protoPayload | select(.authenticationInfo.principalEmail == "david.smith8391273718@gmail.com") | {authenticationInfo,requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}' logs.json | grep "bucket"
```

![Q2](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q2.png)

```shell
jq '.[].protoPayload | select(.authenticationInfo.principalEmail == "david.smith8391273718@gmail.com") | {authenticationInfo, requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}' logs.json | grep -A 10
```

```
confidential-documents-482374561
```

### Q3 Considering the attacker's focus on data exfiltration, what's the name of the object they may have exfiltrated within the first accessed bucket?

```shell
jq '.[].protoPayload | select(.authenticationInfo.principalEmail == "david.smith8391273718@gmail.com") | {authenticationInfo, requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}' logs.json | grep -B 15 "storage.objects.get"
```

```

### Q4 Knowing each step the attacker takes is crucial. What's the name of the Compute Engine instance the attacker accessed?

![Q4](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q4.png)

```
monitoring-instance
```

### Q5 What service account is used by the Compute instance for calls to Google Cloud APIs?

![Q5](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q5.png)

```
cloudops-service@hybrid-elixir-370815.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Q6 In the process of exfiltrating data, identify the Google Cloud SQL database the attacker attempted to export. What is the database's name?

```shell
jq '.[].protoPayload | select(.authenticationInfo.principalEmail == "david.smith8391273718@gmail.com") | {authenticationInfo, requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}' logs.json | grep -B 20 "sql"
```

![Q6](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q6.png)

```
analytics-db
```

### Q7 Tracking the data movement, which Google Cloud Storage bucket did the attacker attempt to export the database to?

```shell
jq '.[].protoPayload | select(.authenticationInfo.principalEmail == "david.smith8391273718@gmail.com") | {authenticationInfo, requestMetadata,authorizationInfo}' logs.json | grep -B 20 "sql"
```

```
backup-repository-543268313682
```

### Q8 In the attacker's effort to maintain access, identify the new service account created by the attacker. What is the account ID of this service account?

```
jq '.[]' logs.json | grep -A 20 "iam.serviceAccounts.create"
```

![Q8](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q8.png)

```
cloud-ops-service
```

### Q9 As part of establishing persistence, what is the ID of the secret key generated for the newly created service account?

```
jq '.[]' logs.json | grep -A 20 "iam.serviceAccountKeys.create"
```

![Q9](/static/images/GoogleCloudHunt/Q9.png)
