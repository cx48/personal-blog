This is a **medium** level **endpoint forensics** lab by **CyberDefenders**. You can complete your analysis using either **Eric Zimmerman Tools** and **MemProcFS**. Start by reading `Before Getting Started` section for more details on how to use these tools.

## Before Getting Started

You should parse event log files for easier analysis using `Evtxcmd` and then analyze them using `Timeline Explorer`

1. We'll first mount our memory dump file using **Memprocfs**

```powershell
.\memprocfs.exe -device "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Start Here\Artifacts\memory.dmp" -forensic 2
```

![step-1](/static/images/Andromeda/step-1.png)

2. Once done you should see the mount point under drive `M:\`. Go to `M:\misc\` drag and drop `eventlog` folder to desktop. Create another folder named `out` there. Now we can parse all the **.evtx** log files using Eric Zimmermans tool **Evtxcmd**.

3. Move to folder containing Evtxcmd using Powershell and type the command below

```powershell
.\EvtxECmd.exe -d "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\eventlog" --csv "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\out"
```

![step-3](/static/images/Andromeda/step-3.png)

4. The will parse all our **.evtx** files and save them as CSV in out folder on the desktop. We will later analyze these files using Timeline Explorer ![step-4](/static/images/Andromeda/step-4.png)

5. Next open Timeline explorer from `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\Start Here\Tools\Log Analysis` and drop **.csv** file right into it. You will end up with all the logs which you can correlate ![step-5](/static/images/Andromeda/step-5.png)

## CTF Walkthrough

From here on you can find answers/flags for each question asked in this lab. I solved this lab using my own methodology or way of finding answers. You may do it differently and that's completely fine

### Q1 Tracking the serial number of the USB device is essential for identifying potentially unauthorized devices used in the incident, helping to trace their origin and narrow down your investigation. What is the serial number of the inserted USB device?

- I started by searching for `USB` using the search bar. I was able to find out the serial number which is `7095411056659025437`. Remember when submitting this serial number as flag you need to add **&0** at the end ![Q1](/static/images/Andromeda/Q1.png)

### Q2 Tracking USB device activity is essential for building an incident timeline, providing a starting point for your analysis. When was the last recorded time the USB was inserted into the system?

- Using the same search from the previous question. I first sort by `time created` field and then I look for map description field of each event. You'll see that last `USB/VHD Insertion/Removal` event happened on `2024-10-04 13:48:18` and this should be our flag for this question

### Q3 Identifying the full path of the executable provides crucial evidence for tracing the attack's origin and understanding how the malware was deployed. What is the full path of the executable that was run after the PowerShell commands disabled Windows Defender protections?

- Next in the event ID field I search for events with ID of `403` which will tell us what Powershell commands were executed. Sort them by `Time created` field again and check the last command under `Payload Data`. We'll end up with our flag  `E:\hidden\Trusted Installer.exe` ![Q3](/static/images/Andromeda/Q3.png)

### Q4 Identifying the bot malwareâ€™s C&C infrastructure is key for detecting IOCs. According to threat intelligence reports, what URL does the bot use to download its C&C file?

- Start finding C2 server with Virustotal by using the MD5 hash value of exe binary  available in field `Payload Data3` as `BC76BD7B332AA8F6AEDBB8E11B7BA9B6` ![Q4](/static/images/Andromeda/Q4.png)
- in the behavior tab analyze the C2 section and you'll find the link which was used to download files for C2 `http://anam0rph.su/in.php` ![Q4-1](/static/images/Andromeda/Q4-1.png)

### Q5 Understanding the IOCs for files dropped by malware is essential for gaining insights into the various stages of the malware and its execution flow. What is the MD5 hash of the dropped .exe file?

- On searching for the process name `trusted installer.exe` using the search bar again. We can see a process creation event and it's executable information which is `"C:\Users\Tomy\AppData\Local\Temp\Sahofivizu.exe" "E:\hidden\Trusted Installer.exe" ` ![Q5](/static/images/Andromeda/Q5.png)
- It's clearly visible that parent process `Trusted Installer.exe` is executing it's payload `Sahofivizu.exe`. On the left you'll see a MD5 hash value of this process and that should be our flag `7FE00CC4EA8429629AC0AC610DB51993` ![Q5-1](/static/images/Andromeda/Q5-1.png)

### Q6 Having the full file paths allows for a more complete cleanup, ensuring that all malicious components are identified and removed from the impacted locations. What is the full path of the first DLL dropped by the malware sample?

-  After using the same search from Q5. We can see over 5 `FileCreate` event ![Q6](/static/images/Andromeda/Q6.png)
- On analyzing the `TargetFileame` field under `Playload Data4` we can see the DLL that was created or dropped by the malware is in `C:\Users\Tomy\AppData\Local\Temp\Gozekeneka.dll` ![Q6-1](/static/images/Andromeda/Q6-1.png)

### Q7  Connecting malware to APT groups is crucial for uncovering an attack's broader strategy, motivations, and long-term goals. Based on IOCs and threat intelligence reports, which APT group reactivated this malware for use in its campaigns?

- I started searching for andromeda malware and anything linked to it's origin. I came across the article by [computerweekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252528934/Russias-Turla-falls-back-on-old-malware-C2-domains-to-avoid-detection) and it turns out that this malware is used by a Russian APT group which goes by name `Turla` ![Q7](/static/images/Andromeda/Q7.png)
