This is a **easy** level **threat intelligence** lab by [CyberDefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/opencti-101/). I usually explain each step of the walkthrough in detail, but this one primarily contains flags and screenshots showing how I obtained each flag.

## Scenario

As a Threat Intelligence Analyst at SecureShot MDR, you play a key role in uncovering and analyzing emerging cyber threats to strengthen proactive defense. Currently focused on APT29, you leverage OpenCTI to track their evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures—connecting malware artifacts, infrastructure patterns, and past operations. Your intelligence directly informs detection strategies, helping the organization anticipate and mitigate advanced threats with precision.

## APT 29 - Targeting & Tradecraft Overview

### Q1 Understanding which sectors are targeted can help prioritize defenses and threat detection. Which industries have been targeted by APT29?
