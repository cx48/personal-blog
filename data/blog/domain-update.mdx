## Hi, there!

I have purchased another domain which is [charanpreet.xyz](https://www.charanpreet.xyz) it will soon point to this webpage. Other domains with TLDs like `.com`, `.org`, `.net` are currently either booked or are availiable for higher prices, around $1000 or more.

Domains that belong to me are [charanpreet.dev](https://www.charanpreet.dev) and [charanpreet.xyz](https://www.charanpreet.xyz). If you're reaching out to me. Make sure you always use any of the two domains mentioned above.

If there's any other domain related to my name availiable for purchase (assuming it's affordable for me). I will look into it and will update all the information related to it in this blog or in the [about me](https://blog.charanpreet.dev/about) of this web page.

*Thanks to [PorkBun](https://www.porkbun.com) for offering great service and domains!*

More information and socials for reaching out will be added soon. Telegram and meetings link will be added then! Thank you!
